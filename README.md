# Graystone Solutions: Project Zoey
# 
## Philosophy
Project codename "Zoey" is an exploratory effort to discover the scope and scalabilty of the current private A.I. landscape without the backing of a major congolomorate and teams of developers. Graystone understands that many other project such as this exist (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artificial_intelligence_projects) our attempt is not to surpase these projects, but merely to understand this endevor and cultivate our own knowledge in this bleeding edge horizon.
## Foundation
Zoey is written in the python language and developed to operate on a Centos 7.0 platform using a basic static. Zoey brings her own dependency stack to the host and installs accordingly. A basic Zoey install will operate using the Natural Language Toolkit for rudimenatry linguistics.

## Evolution
Future plans include several code modules which can be installed for interface with various platforms such as social media networks, or smart home systems.
