# Graystone Security: Project Zoey
# 
## 
Project codename "Zoey" is a discovery project intended to discover the scope and possibly of building a rudimentary A.I. "being" capable of self-learning and self-improvement. Graystone understands that many other project such as this exist (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artificial_intelligence_projects) our attempt is not to surpase these projects, but merely to understand this endevor and self-improve our own knowledge in this growing field. Future plans include the possiblity of building an A.I. capable of providing automated security monitoring for sensitive networks.

## Getting Started

Zoey is written in the python 2.7.5 language and developed in Centos 7.0. Zoey can take advantage of several APIs, each of which can be installed as a seperate modules. For manual installation, see MODULES.txt
Future automated installations will call module_installer.py
